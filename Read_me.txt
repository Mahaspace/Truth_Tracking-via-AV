This archive contains the supplementary material to the paper. Namely, it contains the image annotation datasets originally collected by by Shah, Zhou, and Peres and accessible through this link:https://cs.cmu.edu/~nihars/data/data_approval.zip , and the code.

The file Experiments_Text_Lang_Anim.py contains the functions that implement the aggregation rules mentionned in our papers that we applied to the three datasets.
